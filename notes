Problem:
The turtlebot upstart script couldn't access the USB port.

Solution:
http://answers.ros.org/question/11185/cant-access-turtlebot-through-ttyusb0/?answer=16585#answer-container-16585

Add the following line in the /etc/udev/rules.d/52-turtlebot.rules:

ATTRS{idProduct}=="2008",ATTRS{idVendor}=="0557",MODE="666",GROUP="turtlebot"

2008 and 0557 is either the vendor or product id. You can find that out from lsusb. The problem is that the ttyUSB0 does not have the approprite permission.
